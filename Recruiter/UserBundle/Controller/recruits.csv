I am a experienced Multimedia Design professional, who is passionate and eager to create great award winning designs. So far in Multimedia Design, I have worked on varied project briefs with clients and brands which have ranged from Sky Television to News International. Consequently, I have been able to use and develop a variety of design styles - I am now ready for the next challenge.&nbsp;<br />My degree in Multimedia Design equips me with robust interface creation skills, with a view to enhancing and improving the front end user experience. I have strong graphic design skills with experience in Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Dreamweaver. I am able to design accurate concept mock ups of platforms such as websites, micro sites, online games, and online advertising formats. There have also been times where I have edited video footage with After Effects and created motion graphic effects on smaller sales projects.&nbsp;<br />I am highly sociable and would relish the opportunity to work for such an international and diverse company.&nbsp;<br />I currently work for a mobile games company who have exclusive White Label contracts to produce mobile games for two of the UK's &nbsp;National Newspapers.<br />My role at the games company, involves designing multimedia content, for the UK&rsquo;s largest mobile games operator. I create static and animated banners advertised across the top five mobile phone providers in the UK.&nbsp;<br />These banners have been instrumental to the ROI of the company since July 2008. Here are some examples http://www.ab1design.com/external_gallery.html. During August 2008, banner No.27 brought in 2100 real money players during a four hour evening slot &nbsp;on the Three Mobile Portal, while being placed as a top spot advert. It produced the highest click through rate of that month on the Three Mobile Network.<br />I am a quick learner and have worked on many advertising toolkits as part of a team, as well as on my own. I find working in groups particularly rewarding, as it allows me to share and receive creative knowledge. Over the past three years, I have been able to manage multiple projects on my own and have a keen eye for detail. I enjoy finding innovative solutions to design problems and in my current role, I have often had to think laterally to solve client problems.&nbsp;<br />It would be excellent to talk with you further, about any opportunities you may have that are suitable for me.&nbsp;<br />I look forward to hearing from you,<br />Kind Regards,<br />Alex Addae-Brobbey</p>","1","1",\N,"7377fdab-a965-102d-a262-713cda8f4094.pdf",\N,\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-05-05 08:06:19"

<p>My name is Andrzej Szaszkiewicz and I am currently seeking employment as a CGI &amp; 3D Artist, 3D Modeller or similar. I live in Crumpsall, but although I would prefer to find a role in the Greater Manchester area, I'm able to travel as I hold a Full Drivers Licence. My last position was working for Mi (formerly AHD Imaging) in Salford as a 3D Artist for nearly three years. I have left Mi because I felt I got as far as I could with my job there and so I wish to expand my skill set and learn more elsewhere.</p>\
<p>The role that I seek now is one that's permanent, although I would consider contracting but only if the assignment suited and in a convenient location to travel to. The preferred basic salary is &pound;20,000+ possibly with benefits or an hourly rate of &pound;14/17 upwards. I am however open to negotiation should any position be closer to Crumpsall. My CV is attached for your perusal in the hope that you can help me seek employment as soon as possible. I am available immediately and can sign up with an umbrella company should you be able to offering any contract work.</p>\
<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>\

<p>For the past year I have been working at Eclipse Interactive where I have been primarily producing low end 2D and 3D artwork for the Iphone platform.  During this time I was also selected by Sega to produce an online level editor for Sonic the Hedgehog; this involved designing a level, which complemented the Mega Drive game, in a way that allowed users to create their own scenario.  Pryor to this I was working in a similar role creating artwork for mobile devices at a mobile phone games studio owned by Eidos.  I am required to have precise time management and liaise with other members of the studio.  I have also worked in a Manchester based 3D architectural company where my role was to take pre-existing plans and create photo-realistic buildings for a number of different housing contractors.  I communicated firsthand with clients and independently managed my own work.</p>\

Being a web designer, content editor, writer and trainer for more than 15 years, I can make a positive contribution. Current examples of my wriiten work can be seen at: http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/about/features/ <br /><br />Skilled in HTML, CSS, Photoshop and Flash, I manage content in blogs, facebook twitter and am keen on web technologies for communication. I am hardworking, enthusiastic and flexible. I am self-motivated and able to bring out the best in others. People are the most rewarding and challenging part of my work; I enjoy that contact very much.&nbsp; My portfolio is at: http://go.bath.ac.uk/itsme<br /><br />Half of my time is spent working with the university's press team. I am involved in producing press releases, writing features, answering media queries, editing videos and contributing to overall media strategy. I also work with publications, print and design staff on media campaigns and commission work.<br /><br />As a trainer, I produce teaching materials. I am a confident public speaker who is at ease with anyone. My latest training presentation is at www.bath.ac.uk/web/writetrack I work with people from across the university on a daily basis. I have experience of managing staff. I have over 20 years' teaching experience in adult, secondary and primary age groups. At present, I teach as part of my job and voluntarily on a student union programme. I have lead several successful collaborative partnership projects at universities, with local government and the private sector. <br /><br />At the University of Bath, the biggest was a complete redesign of the School for Health website. For 12 months from 2007-8, I was responsible for migrating 6 departmental websites to the university's content management system. This involved managing relationships with front-end and development teams, departmental web maintainers, external contractors and supervising project staff.<br /><br />When employed by the University of Bristol, I designed a new website for the Health Services Research Collaboration. It was launched at a national media event. <br /><br />Working for Bristol's CREATE centre, a collaboration between council, community groups and businesses, I headed a European-funded project for PC-based video conferencing. I also looked after the public access IT facilities, their website and was involved in all promotion of the environment centre. In addition, I project-managed and delivered on time, a case administration system for Bristol City Council's directorate of Health and Environmental services.<br /><br />I am happy working in a multi-contractor environment. I can explain complex, technical things in plain language. Before getting involved with web design and content, I worked for several years in IT support. I have good problem solving and analytical skills. <br /><br />Music is a keen interest and I play drums. I am also interested in many forms of visual art, craft using recycled materials, cartooning and drawing. I am a cyclist and have chosen a car-free lifestyle.<br /><br /></p>","1","2",\N,"cef2eff4-b4d6-102d-9961-af35f943642b.pdf",\N,\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-05-19 21:26:08"

<p><b><i>&ldquo;Chris Taylor&rsquo;s cover for my first book of poems, Across My Silence was stunningly apropos, setting the perfect tone for the work inside. I was so intrigued with his richly layered image that I asked the publisher to break precedence and include his name and description of the&nbsp; composition on the copyright page for all to see. Starting with its subtle backdrop of shadowy leaves and wa&shy;ter, offset by a dramatic jewel of a monarch butterfly, and finishing on the back with a simple rendering of a gentle sea turtle, the cover art reflected themes and specific elements actually in the poems. I would go as far as to say Taylor&rsquo;s artwork was a visual poem that gave extension and lustre to my own metaphors and ideas. Because of his creative efforts, I implore potential readers to judge my book by its cover!&rdquo;<br /></i></b>Jack Cooper: Author, Across My Silence</p>\

<p>I have many years experience in the graphics industry, working on a range of projects from retail packaging and point of sale, through to maps and information design. I am enthusiastic about what I do, always striving to produce the best work possible. I relish the technical and creative challenges thrown up by working in this industry and have a wealth of experience to offer in dealing with them. In addition to this, I am adaptable, flexible, willing to learn and always receptive to new ideas.</p>\
<p>Use of these software packages: Adobe Illustrator CS (core) / Adobe Photoshop CS (secondary) / Adoble InDesign CS (secondary) / QuarkXpress (secondary)</p>\
<p>Preparing artwork for: Retail packaging / Retail point of sale / Map production / Information design / Posters / Newsletters</p>\
<p><b>Competencies and personal attributes</b></p>\
<p>I am pro-active and always take time at the start of a project to plan how the work will proceed, flag up any potential problems in order to resolve them, and ensure there are no unforeseen hitches as the deadline approaches.</p>\
<p>However, life is far from perfect and when problems inevitably arise, I react to solve them as swiftly as possible while keeping the project on track.</p>\
<p>In the graphics industry, there have been and always will be last minute rush jobs &ndash; I have learnt to accommodate these and keep the rest of the work schedule on track.</p>\
<p>I have honed my communication skills in order to deal with the above on a day to day basis while remaining calm.</p>\
<p>I am a willing team player, however when required I am adaptable enough to be able to work independently, being the sole person engaged on a project.</p>\
<p>I have an eye for detail and consistency which are maintained even under pressure.</p>\
<p>I comply well with deadlines, continually achieving to complete work on time due to a flexible attitude.</p>\
<p><b>Most recent employment</b></p>\
<p>April 2007 - December 2009 - Tenderwood Prestige - TAH House, Aviation Way, Southend-on-Sea</p>\
<p>The majority of the work was retail packaging for Marks and Spencer. I produced packaging artwork using supplied design files, images, copy briefs, cutter guides and the print specification. While I wasn&rsquo;t required to produce 100% repro ready artwork, I was required to apply varnish layers, printing white layers and set overprints as requested. I always had good communication with the repro team to ensure that the artworks were set up correctly for their purposes. The factors for success with this work were attention to detail, an understanding of corporate style guidelines, particularly relating to back of pack copy and the increasing amount of information that has to be displayed on food packaging.</p>\
<p>The loss of Marks and Spencer as a client led to the closure of Tenderwood Prestige and my redundancy.</p>","1","1",\N,"64d0da9e-da3b-102d-bdbe-fed7399850c5.pdf","4407d43c-da3b-102d-bdbe-fed7399850c5.pdf",\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-07-06 11:25:05"

I realized that to be successful I would need to learn more programs and enhance my skills so as of late I have ventured into graphic design, using my skills to create graphics for T-shirts, advertisements and personal ventures.

I have been working in the industry for a relatively short time (2 years) but I have learned so far.</p>\
<p>As a designer, my passions lie in typography and minimalism and I really love poster art. I also enjoy Japanese anime. Watching films by the likes of Hayao Miyazaki is an absolute pleasure.</p>\
<p>Check out my portfolio site to get a guage on my design tastes. My designs tend to be an eclectic mix and I'll rarely stick to single style for more than one or two projects at a time.</p>\
<p>There are many other aspects of my life that influence my design senses. Music, and more specifically guitar and singing, is a huge part of who I am. I also love playing sports and being active. I believe that having numerous creative outlets can only be benificial. They all influence each other to create a more substantial whole. And from that, I am a better designer.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;I am writing to you to apply and enclose my CV to provide a summary of my qualifications and background. I am a French designer, hold a Bachelor of Arts in Visuals and Plastics Arts and Space specialising in fashion design, and am extremely keen to expand my work experience in London.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;After university, I undertook an internship at the Paris trends and design agency Promostyl, where I developed various style trends for the Junior Clothing Department. Following this, I undertook a design software course at Valarep center to study Illustrator, Photoshop &amp; Quark Xpress and created advertisements for briefs relating to cultural events and fashion. These experiences have helped me become proficient with all major design software.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;For four years, I held a position in retail at menswear brand LKG. Through this position, I gained experience fashion marketing, developed a strong understanding of customer services. In this role I enjoyed working as part of a team, and was responsible for managing and supervising staff, as well as reporting to senior staff members. Always keen to incorporate my design experience, in 2006, as part of my retail work, I participated in a design contest chaired by Belgian fashion designer Olivier Strelli, and was shortlisted as a finalist with women&rsquo;s collection project.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;In 2008, I spent one year in Australia to improve my English language and communication skills, and am a fluent English speaker. I am living in London and I recently finished an internship for a Graphic Designer, during which I undertook various research and design roles. I have recently collaborated as a Freelance Illustrator to create a book cover for Penguin Publishing company, and illustrate regularly for emerging design brand Eyola. I am currently working as a freelance PR Assistant for a new fashion magazine calls Side View, and am keen to utilise and develop my skills within your organisation. I&rsquo;m organised, motivated and enthusiastic, and I would love the opportunity to become a member of your team.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\

In  order to sharpen my design skills I did an HND in Graphic Design which  gave me good practice in logo design and editorial layouts for print  and web.</p>\
<p>Most recently I have become more in tune with the digital side  of design by completing a web design course. The course provided me with  a broad understanding of HTML and CSS and has ultimately given me the  skills to build and design effective websites.</p>\
<p>It has broadened my skill-set when I take on freelance projects. I  now have the best of both worlds where I can produce the design work but also update web pages if required. <br /><br />I've arrived at a  point where I feel I would like to develop my web skills further within  an established digital agency.</p>","1","1",\N,"b6db7d74-c161-102d-9961-af35f943642b.pdf",\N,"72f4c010-c163-102d-9961-af35f943642b.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-06-04 20:22:54"

<p><br />&ldquo;There is only you and your camera. The limitations in your photography are in yourself, for what we see is what we are.&rdquo;<br />(Ernst Haas)<br /><br /></p>\
<p>I am one of those lucky people who gets to do a job that they love, every event is a new adventure, and the amazing people I meet, are a bonus! I bought my first camera from Argos for &pound;9.99, and the journey began...<br /><br />I was offered a training contract and position as a photographer, for an international photographic company whilst still in year 11 at school. Although I initially turned the offer down, through curiosity I found myself at the interview. I trained for two years with highly respected members of the Master Photographers Association.<br /><br />I later went on to specialize in wedding and events photography. I have worked on various projects for a Viva magazine and DV8 Magazine,as well as being a freelance photographer in the north of England. I like to explore all aspects of photography, particularly the contradictions between modern and classic portraiture. However my favourite techniques include relaxed, un-posed and natural coverage, I feel these shots allow me to capture the true emotions of the day, event or individual.<br /><br />I see each event as unique. I follow no specific routine and have no template of shots. I like to get to know the individuals and cater to their specific needs, after all, your photographs will be of your most cherished memories.&nbsp;<br /><br />I look forward to showing you my interpretation of the beauty of art, and the art of memories.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hannah .....</p>","1","1",\N,\N,\N,"290cf27e-5e8c-102e-9d29-49bfe1292c61.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-12-21 19:50:38"

<p>I have always written...something... anything! I studied English Literature and Studies in Modern Writing at University and that is where my passion for words really started.&nbsp; I have had a number of poems published and I am in the process of writing a series of Children&rsquo;s books.\

Hartland Creative came to be in 2009 when I realised my passion and talent for writing could be used effectively and adapted to suit any market, commercially and within the world of Business.\

<p>With over 7 years experience at top level design in the UK, I am an ambitious person who revels in creativity. I love my job, I am proud of my work and feel privileged to be part of a rewarding industry. I have real attention to detail.</p>\
<p>I've work for Lloyds TSB, Yell.com, IBM, Intel, E.ON, Npower, Vision Express and the NHS to name just a few.</p>\
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working for a large national advertising agency until recently setting up my own business. I am fluent in Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Quark &amp; InDesign to name a few. I would call myself as a visual sponge.</p>\
<p>I love all aspects of graphic design/advertising from branding/identity, online media, outdoor media, press, web design, brochures, exhibition design and most importantly the conceptual process of building a campaign.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I am truly hardworking and enthusiastic when given a brief. I have a great attitude and I possess lots and lots of enthusiasm and willingness to learn.</p>\
<p>I always deliver on time; with experience of managing large projects, managing multiple work loads, working well under pressure, always completing work to tight deadlines at a high level.</p>\
<p><b>WorkHistory</b>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>In 2006 I was hired as a Senior Designer/Art Director at TMP Worldwide.</p>\
<p>I took my chance to develop accounts and stand out, working on some of the largest projects and campaigns. I would be leading the creative myself, generating ideas, directing photoshoots, liasing with account directors and chipping in on pitches/presentations. I would report to the creative director but not daily. I had confidence and people had confidence in me to do the job.</p>\
<p>The nature of this business meant the campaigns had to be turned around in a matter of days, often less. The timescales were really tight as well as the budgets. I produced some great work under these conditions, it often helped. It got the best out of me I enjoyed the pressure.</p>\
<p>I was responsible for some key accounts. This included delivering the right style following stringent guidelines, innovative routes to market, fresh ideas/campaigns, production of artwork &amp; brochures, national press campaigns, microsites and the development of some brands.</p>","1","2",\N,\N,\N,\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-01-12 18:11:45"

Working alongside the MD, I built up the brand style guide, content design for the e-commerce area, as well at the magazine-led editorial sections. Always developing new and better ways to enhance the user experience within the brand (a luxurious and unique experience).</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>My responsibility as Senior Designer, was to keep the site &lsquo;fresh-looking&rsquo; by updating the following: home page (with new animated content); the &lsquo;New Arrivals&rsquo; page; the 4 x magazine contents pages (which showed new featured stories weekly); design of the weekly &lsquo;email&rsquo; (and mobile version of the email); banner ADS for viral marketing (flash / jpeg / animated gif), landing pages for our Google ADs; and some partnership site/holding pages. I have also a little experience with other multimedia such as optimising film for web, for flash.</p>\

Over the years I have put together many pitches and successfully won new work &ndash; and, with a strong focus on creative excellence, these led to the winning of many awards along the way (APA, PPA, MDA).</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I have had roughly nine years of experience working in 3D industry.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Over the last two years I have completed a period of freelance work as Interior Designer and 3D Visualiser. I was responsible for creation of different interior and exterior projects and CAD visualizations for private investors. The most recently it has been CAD Design for private property (inside and outside).</p>\
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\
<p>My previous experience includes seven years of employment in Kiev &ndash; the capital of Ukraine. I was part of a highly creative and professional team, delivering a high standard of interior and CAD design services. I have also a great deal experience in creation 3D projects for restaurants, high street shops and offices.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I am an avid 3D Designer and I am very keen on pursuing a career in the CAD Design industry. My artistic skills are very high and very professional and I have experience with the most current aspects of 3D asset creation. I have a deep knowledge base of Photoshop, AutoCAD, and ArchiCAD while most recently indulging in 3D Max.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review my application.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Sincerely,</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\

After leaving school in June 2005 I went to work a few days a week for Tamworth Graphix. This introduced me to the skill of cutting and applying vinyl. Making signs and other visual aspects of sign making. After being there for two years I moved on and pursued a life long ambition of becoming a DJ. I now have all my own equipment needed for doing mobile discos.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;<br />Whist doing discos on the sideline I then had an opportunity to work for R.A.R.E in Twycross as a computer games tester. That soon ended as the game we were testing got released and only a few of us that had been there form the start had been kept on. I then had to sign on to JSA as I was looking for a job, this in turn got me a work experience placement at Graphic Wizard LTD. (Tamworth)<br />Here I was introduced to the art of Screen Printing and Banner Making. Most of my artwork from this site was made for Graphic Wizard.</p>\
<p><br />I now currently have over 5 Years experience with Photoshop ( Everything I know I have taught myself! ) And I am now currently using the Adobe CS3 Master Collection as I intend to teach myself how to use the rest of the programs. And all my artwork is designed to keep the quality during the print process, even with enlarged images and photographs.</p>\
<p><br />I am now currently doing discos on the side as normal with the intent on becoming a freelance art worker, second to this If you require, because of my contacts with PDQ Printing and Graphic Wizard LTD., I can also get your artwork printed at a decent price.</p>\
<p>The type of work I can print are as follows....</p>\

<p>Having worked as a Graphic Designer in an experienced agency and also a Head Graphic Designer in a print house, I am used to being creative with challenging briefs, tackling tight deadlines and have firsthand knowledge of print processes.</p>\
<p>I enjoy the creative practice, from helping the client tailor a brief that suits their particular needs, to developing a finished product that surpasses their expectations.

I am able to stick tightly to a brief and guidelines or create a large range of graphic styles and ideas, depending on what is needed.</p>\
<p>My agency design role is not only to design for print but also to produce visuals for an array of websites in different sectors. In my free time, I am currently learning CSS and XHTML so that I can also build the websites I design for.

I've worked in the charity and private  sectors, in publishing and design studios, creating both editorial and  marketing products. I enjoy combining considered typography with  striking photography to create clean and effective work.</p>\
<p>From starting out at Runner's World magazine, via the UK's biggest  disability publication and a dynamic design studio, I've worked my way  up to Art Director. I've helped run the art desk of Time Magazine  Europe, managed the marketing design output for Which?, and freelanced  for great people such as Sunday Publishing and Square One Publishing.</p>\
<p>Whether I'm working on lifestyle, B2C, B2B magazines or marketing  products, I always follow the same meticulous approach in my design. I  endeavour to exceed a client's expectations whilst firmly fulfilling the  most demanding of briefs. I'm not afraid to say if something isn't  working and if a new approach is required.</p>\
<p>During my career I have gained considerable experience of art  direction, running design teams and commissioning photographers and  illustrators. I always enjoy working with other design, editorial and  marketing professionals to create the best possible product, but am also  more than happy to work autonomously if required.</p>\
<p>Having started out as a Production Editor, I'm frequently asked to  take projects from initial client briefing through to press passing at  the printers.

<p>Unlike my competitors, who many seemed to accidently become designers, I have long since known I was destined to become a designer at an early age.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;I also learned while in college at Rochester Institute of Technology, that business success was not easy for most people.</p>\
<p>After many years working full time for many of the leading corporations and larger printing facilities;</p>\
<p>Texaco, Disney, Universal Studios, Gulf Oil, Eric Adams Furniture, Nautilus Sports, Silver Moon Concepts, Raleigh Design and Church Street Station.</p>\
<p>I gained the knowledge of how design effects sales, makes people respond to certain ads, direct mail and newspaper ads.</p>\
<p><b>&nbsp;My theory is......</b></p>\
<p>Why hire just web designer when you can have someone that knows how to bring all the pieces together and actually has experience designing for business. I can get your Site Optimized so people can find it. Even better make it customer friendly which is so lacking these days.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Your advertising dollar means as much to me as to you. So the success of your web site, brochure, business cards, shirts, hats, and other services that I offer is of the utmost importance. I do advertise in on the web and do my own direct mail, but word of mouth is icing on the marketing plan. I do as I advise my clients. Makes you wonder why my agency doesn't advertise but wants me to let them do mine?</p>\
<p>&nbsp;Please feel free to call/email if you have any questions. I offer perspective clients one hour of my time to learn about your needs and wants. If you go with my services or not, you're sure to know more about the internet and the search engines before making a choice with another company.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for learning a little about me and Lion's Breath Studio of Design, I do appreciate it!!</p>","1","1",\N,\N,\N,"793db724-7259-102d-8931-b9710be14bd0.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-02-24 02:41:55"

These projects have included ground breaking technologies and award winning designs. This has given me a rich insight and understanding of the industry as a whole. This knowledge and expertise I bring to all my projects big or small, staying clear of pitfalls before they happen and pushing the project above and beyond client/stakeholders expectations.</p>\
<p>During the past 5yrs I have specialised in Ecommerce and Emarketing, designing, building of websites, micro sites and banners that include Flash/Giff animations. The full life cycle projects involved working with SEO specialists, AB, UX, UI, testing. I can produce a highly professional design from the most minimal of briefs and in a short space of time. I work on many different brands a day and design seamlessly from client to client.</p>\
<p>I have a great eye for detail, layout balance and enjoy sharing this knowledge with junior or senior colleagues I work with. This is a two way street, I also learn from those people around me. The passing of knowledge between colleagues is of the upmost importance when working together as a team. This means that the company as a whole is kept abreast of new technologies and advancements in the industry. The team and company are always at the cutting edge of the sector.</p>\
<p>You will see from my profile in Linkedin.com I work well with others and have a very positive outlook on life.</p>\
<p>Nothing is too much for me to help a colleague or go that extra mile for the company I work for at the time.</p>\
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those fortunate people that feel very passionate about their work. I do see what I do as an informative art form and take it very seriously that I have a message to portray for the client, but just as importantly the customer base understands that message.</p>\
<p>My portfolio website is under a redesign at the moment. If you require more examples of my work please do not hesitate to ask. My most recent design work is in a PDF format that I would be happy to send.</p>\

I have been freelancing at IPC Media and on a number of other freelance projects including regular work for The Royal Automobile Club - based in Pall Mall, London.<br /><br />As the Art Editor for the magazine for the members magazine for the Royal Automobile Club I work as the sole designer serving the client by attending editorial board meetings, organising photoshoots, designing all 64 pages, redesigns, layout, templating, managing magazine budgets, managing freelance staff, comissioning illustrators, all-house repro, re-touching of any images and finally sending all pages to print all within a very strict deadline.<br /><br />I have experience producing the corporate customer magazine for Yorkshire Building Society. I have also worked for a range of corporate clients including Subaru, Bank of Scotland, Skipton Building Society, Wentworth Golf Club, St. John Ambulance, Headmasters and of course my main client the Royal Automobile Club.<br /><br />I have also produced designs for other projects including ezines, advertisements, POS and DM.<br /><br />I have also worked as a freelancer within consumer publishing. My most recent consumer contract was at the BBC on a new weekly launch called Match of the Day Magazine. The launch was very successful and after first issue sales of over 115k the magazine is circulating at over 100k each week. Again my role was to create new templates and page designs, working alongside a new editorial and production team.<br /><br />Within that year as a freelancer I had worked on a range of titles including Horse &amp; Pony magazine for Eagle Moss Publications. On a weekly celebrity magazine called Star at the Express group (www.northernandshell.co.uk/media/starmag). At IPC media on Soaplife (www.ipcmedia.com/brands/soaplife) a fortnightly Soap/TV magazine. I had also been working at the BBC on a children&rsquo;s magazine called GirlTalk (www.bbcgirltalk.com) and on the award winning BBC Good Homes magazine. I also worked on a monthly magazine at Future Publishing called DVD Review (www.dvdreview.co.uk).<br /><br />Previously to working as a freelancer, I decided to take a year out to see the world but before that I spent four years working to a standard of Middleweight Designer at Dive Magazine for Circle Publishing (www.circlepublishing.net) based in Richmond. There I switched to InDesign CS and worked along side my Art Director producing a monthly consumer title called Dive (www.divemagazine.co.uk).<br /><br />I also worked as the sole designer on a smaller title for a marketing company on a title called GradJobs (www.gradjobs.co.uk/magazine). Again I worked as the sole designer for a younger readership producing page designs and also dealing advertisers meaning I was chasing and reviewing advertisements before going to print.<br /><br />I first started my career working as the sole designer on two (B2B) titles at the Daily Mail Group after completing my BA (Hons) in Graphic Design. There I trained in the Photoshop, Illustrator and Quark, all to an advanced level.<br /><br />In all positions I produced high-quality image-led page designs, directed photo-shoots for equipment tests and sourced all images. I was also involved with the production side of things. Here I would send all pages down to print ourselves and would work alongside the printers with any amendments and printing problems that would often occur.<br /><br />I have been working as a magazine designer for over 8 years now and am looking for a permanent or a freelance role that will allow me to continue with my creative side and maybe take me to a more senior role within an established company.&nbsp;As you can see I have a very broad portfolio within consumer, contract and b2b publishing and hope that you are able to bring me in for a meeting so you can help me find that perfect position.<br /><br />If you wanted to have a chat then please feel free to contact me on 07515 674 385.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />Jon Hart<br />Freelance Magazine Designer</p>","1","1",\N,"3001d3b4-9f83-102d-a24d-8a9754df6457.pdf",\N,"224b6883-9f83-102d-a24d-8a9754df6457.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-04-22 18:17:28"

<p>Brief of the Project Objective</p>\
<p>This tool facilitated the capturing of uncertainty data   for various Agilent equipments. This uncertainty data was captured using the   calibration tests performed on the said equipments. An interface to a master repository   was created, where the uncertainty data was stored and updated in real-time.   A process for replication of uncertainty data from master repository to   global spread of repositories was also designed. It involved designing the   functionality to automatically read and upload existing application   uncertainty details from over 300 excel spreadsheets. While implementing an   integrated governance model for data validation and data auditing, this tool   scored its key-win from business users by providing a user friendly user   interface that made capturing and retrieval of complex information more   systematic and streamlined.</p>\
<p>Responsibilities</p>\
<ul>\
<li>To gather business requirements</li>\
<li>Develop an interface for maintaining uncertainties for   application via adding, deleting, editing and exporting applications, their   tests and corresponding uncertainties.</li>\
<li>Create a separate replicate database in to retrieve the   uncertainties for all applications</li>\
<li>Setup replication of data across global database   instances.</li>\
<li>Backup, restore and auditing of uncertainty information.</li>\

The approved ideas/ projects were then available for a panel of evaluators to   perform an online point based evaluation to select the best idea/ project. It   also allowed capturing of comments/ initiation of discussions within the   project teams for getting inputs from wider audience, for selection of the   innovative idea/ project.</p>\

<p>I am currently using an Olympus e410 and have a flash gun also. I like to keep it simple!</p>\
<p>I am able to photograph varies subjects with some skill, my main hobby and interest is 'Urbex' the exploration of abandoned and derelict buildings and places.</p>\
<p>Some of my favourite aspects of my access foundation course were designing, using different media including my newfound passion for photography, to create beautiful designs then progressing within my sketchbook to create a diverse range of ideas, all drawn out from inspiration I derive. I use art not only as a form of creativity, but also as self expression; sometimes the hardest things too explain are the easiest to express as an idea or form of art.</p>\
<p>My roots are in fashion mainly and am a grade one skilled pattern cutter so have produced some garments to wear for photoshoots. I have a&nbsp;lovely 50mm lens which with my style gives some cracking shots.</p>\
<p>I love the diversity and directions I can use within textiles but merging them with my other artwork, whether it's a completely abstract applique, photography, a charcoal portrait or even using media not associated with traditional methods of manipulating materials. Every part of art is appealing to me and I will always look to expand my skills and style.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I have been using photoshop for 5years now, started using it within my fashion course used for surface pattern design for garments and fabric. So i can use the drawing based side of it. But now i tend to use it for post processing and editing photographs. I am also a dab hand with Adobe Lightroom.</p>\

In what started out as an exploration into discovering my personal identity and the relationship I have with both the cultural environments in the United Kingdom and Philippines, it has led to attempting to understand how post-colonialism and multiculturalism has played an integral part as my position as an artist. Through my practice I aim to continue to investigate what position I play within contemporary British art, acknowledging artists and theorists such as Homi Bhaba, Rasheed Araeen, Stuart Hall. My awareness of the historical significance of globalisation, the increase of multiculturalism and post-colonial art is continuing to influence the work I create. <br /><br />Jeffrey Cervantes is currently completing his final year studying Critical Fine Art Practice at the University of Brighton.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I am writing to introduce myself as graduate (BA Hons) in Multimedia Systems Computing - of which I have been a graduate for 6 years...I went travelling around the world around this time last year and have just returned back home. Since my return last month I've recently finished building a Gym website, featuring &amp; utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as flash.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;I finished working for a financial company called Market vendor Jobs in July 2009, of which I was a lead web/graphical designer and also product managed the team developing the main .Net coding for the site. I also managed all of the companies Email marketing campaigns from start to finish, designing them via Photoshop/Illustrator and building them in HTML. Once done I deployed them via the CSS system we were using at the time to our subscriber listing...</p>\
<p>Prior to working for this company, I worked on contract as the Lead Email Support Analyst for Sony Computer Entertainment, managing their email marketing campaigns to their subscriber listings - doing graphical design and email HTML coding for their Online Marketing Campaigns and deployment throughout my time there. Prior to this I also worked for Edialog, of whom I handled a large number of worldwide clients doing much the same thing.</p>\
<p>However, prior to both of these roles I worked with the Essex County Council, and helped to not only design a number of websites, but to also monitor the click through rates via Excel/Access driven databases. I was also in charge of certain projects within the main Essex County Council website, and as a result was the first point of call for certain governmental departments requiring updates and web page changes. I am furthermore fluent with all Microsoft Office applications and am a proven, rapid typist.</p>\

<p>Profile</p>\
<p>I strongly believe that even starting from a young age I was reliable as in Primary school I was a prefect twice this meant I was able to help my fellow students in the younger years. Through high school I tried to concentrate only on my studies and accomplished 9 A-C&rsquo;s. Last year in As I was part of the Student Committee (Student Representative) and Events Committee this meant helping organize events and getting others points heard. This year I am head of the Events Committee and help run the council. I am an artistic, enthusiastic, honest individual with the ability to use my own initiative also punctual, reliable and willing to learn. I&rsquo;m a problem-solver with the ability to adapt well to new situations and to work as an effective team member. Also self-motivated, trustworthy and responsible person who enjoys meeting challenges as well as new people. I was born 27th August 1993, in South Africa and immigrated to the UK when I was 5. I have a current up to date British passport and I have my National Insurance number.</p>\

Imagination can lead to limitless creation from an individual, so the potential of a team is unparalleled.

<p>Project manager of cost effective stunning looking, well converting &amp; search engine friendly websites.</p>\
<p><b>SEO:</b></p>\
<p>The majority of SEO companies are not up to date with their techniques &amp; methods, in fact most of the efforts of SEO staff are completely pointless - yet it takes a long time for this knowledge to filter through &amp; for re-training, which is why companies generally end up speaking to freelance SEO consultants when they're stuck in a rut with their results &amp; require a fresh approach.</p>\
<p>Directory submissions, social bookmarking submissions, article marketing, blog commenting &amp; all that jazz -<b> I do none of that....</b>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>If you're looking for someone who has the ability to make real improvements to your search engine marketing results, and who knows how to mak the vert best of the most recent Google changes, which make most traditional offpage SEO methods relatively useless - then contact me.</p>\
<p>Please note - I don't take on every freelance project I'm offered, I've been doing this long enough to know that I work best with markets, products, and people that I enjoy working with - but if you give me the details, I'll let you know if I think I am the person for the job.</p>\
<p><b>Web Design &amp; Development:</b></p>\
<p>I manage a team of freelance coders &amp; developers - and I project manage web design and development. The websites I project manage the design &amp; development of, are great looking, great converting business websites which are created with a very strong understanding of the overall purpose of the website - and which are built to be very search engine friendly.</p>\
<p>I started to project manage the design &amp; development of business websites when many of my SEO clients required re-design or development work in order to increase search engine friendliness &amp; remove elements which hinder effectiveness of SEO work, and often to improve visitor experience, ease of navigation &amp; to improve the website's ability to convert. I now handle more search engine friendly web design than just about anything else, as so many businesses are coming to realise that they actually have online brochures rather than sites which will climb the search engines &amp; convert visits to customers.</p>\

The job I was doing there restricted me in doing graphic work and also involved taken on other roles as well as my artworker position, such as products manager, web activity monitor and buyer.<br /><br />I feel that I am well qualified to make an effective and useful contribution to a company and meet all the essential criteria of these positions. I am enthusiastic about the chance to participate in a more meaningful role with a graphic design company.<br /><br />Because of my willingness to find a new job quickly I am willing to have less salary then stated on the job role, as a probationary period, until I prove my worth. <br /><br />Thank you for your consideration of my application. Please contact me should you require any further information, <br /><br />Yours faithfully<br /><br />Robert Knowles <br /><br /></p>","1","1",\N,"ea702fd6-daf8-102d-bdbe-fed7399850c5.pdf","dda15ba9-d037-102d-b069-ae838309a00c.pdf",\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-05-25 19:07:45"

My name is Kristine Morel and I am looking for a Graphic Design role in the Chester area. &nbsp;I have recently migrated to Chester, England from Brisbane, Australia. &nbsp;I hold dual Australian and French citizenship and am able to work in the UK on a permanent basis.</p>\
<p>I hold a Bachelor of Communication Design, majoring in Graphic Design and Multimedia and have six years experience working in the graphic design industry. &nbsp;During that time I have worked primarily in the corporate environment across a variety of industries including the mining, financial, property and professional services sectors. &nbsp;With these diverse experiences I have built up a wealth of knowledge and skills, which have enabled me to meet the needs and wants of clients. &nbsp;In 2010 my goal is to find the opportunity to bring my corporate design experience and skills into a challenging design studio role and work with a like-minded team.</p>\
<p>My primary skills are in print based media but I have also designed for many other mediums including merchandise, expo banners and displays, signage, website design and flash animation banners.</p>\
<p>Essential to the successful&nbsp;delivery of these design projects has been my professional approach to dealing with client&rsquo;s needs and my ability to:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>multi-task, </li>\
<li>take responsibility for each project from start to finish, </li>\
<li>work within strict timeframes and budgets, </li>\
<li>ability to work in a team environment,</li>\
<li>maintain client confidentially,</li>\
<li>liaise with clients and suppliers and</li>\
<li>consistently deliver a high level of quality to each project.</li>\
</ul>\
<p>In addition to my design skills I also have a very keen passion for photography. &nbsp;It's a great way to keep the creative juices flowing and I love to get out and photograph outdoors. Samples of my photography can be seen in my sample portfolio.</p>\
<p>For further details of my technical skills and design experience, please find my resume and email portfolio.</p>\

<p>For Reach Global I would design web site mock ups based on a client brief or instructions, once the design had been approved I would then, in some instances, programme the front end and pass it on to a lead developer for the backend work. With smaller sites however I would oversee the design and construction right through to the finished web site.</p>\
<p>I feel the three and half years at Reach has given me great experience within the work place in dealing with client specifications and deadlines. I am now aiming to move into a more design agency based environment as I feel that by surrounding my self with experienced designers it will improve my skills as a designer &amp; developer. <br />&nbsp;<br />Below is a URL to my portfolio site if you wish to take a look at some of the work I have been producing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Regards<br />&nbsp;<br />Lee Demain</p>\

<p>My previous role was in print for bathroom and kitchen accessories, although I have a broad portfolio with strengths in market research, colour, pattern placement and problem solving. I am very familiar using all creative packages such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Planit and In Design and I continue to develop my skills by attending advanced training courses.</p>\
<p>I have experience in working on repeats and this skill combined with my sensitive use of colour, pattern and texture is evident in my designs. Following my graduation in textiles I worked for a company designing bespoke woven fashion fabrics, which enabled me to further develop my sense of texture with sensitive colour placement. I was then subsequently attracted to the role at Pilkington's to enhance my knowledge of another design area, interior surface pattern, and I found my previous experience and skills were easily transferable.</p>\
<p>In my previous role I was responsible for two large multiple accounts, which involved liaising with buyers, presenting new ranges and concept ideas, organising promotional literature, photographic styling and working closely with the account managers. Extensive market research across a broad spectrum of design was conducted to ensure I kept up to date with the latest interior design and fashion trends. I also managed three junior designers, which involved scheduling their work and overseeing their designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Other areas of responsibility included briefing overseas producers, liaising with their designers on new product developments, and sourcing products. I have been influential in negotiating key deals with suppliers and successfully bringing product to market. I worked closely with the technical support team in the on-site factory, particularly with colour trialing, sampling and developing products for new ranges.</p>\
<p>I enjoy the unity of working in a team environment coupled with a role that offers the autonomy to express your own views and ideas.</p>\
<p>I am now eager to further my career and skills and seek employment with a company with good career opportunities.</p>\

<p>The majority of projects that I have been involved in have required self-motivation and the ability   to work as a sole representation and also as a team member, unsupervised whilst always managing my own   time scales and deadlines. &nbsp;I have the ability to keep a clear   conscious when problems occur and with having the experience managing teams   of designers, I have not always had my own problems resting on my shoulders when   deadlines are rapidly approaching.</p>\
<p>My workload, when   deadlines have to be met, have rarely but occasionally lead me to work over   the scheduled time scales i.e. working nights over a weekend to meet a clients   deadline. &nbsp;</p>\
<p>This has usually been the   case when clients have wanted changes to designs at the last minute.</p>\
<p>I have gained a wide   variety of both transferable and specific skills, which relate to working in   media or business/IT:</p>\
<p><b>Design and film experience:</b>&nbsp; Working for&nbsp;large multinational companies such as&nbsp;DuPont, Huntsman, Sensient to name but a few and&nbsp;some Local Governments, &nbsp;Small Businesses and&nbsp;Consumers. &nbsp;I have been lucky enough to be involved with some quite exciting projects involving: filming/editing, designing graphics/animations for the web&nbsp;and print based material at a moderate to high level. &nbsp;These projects have given me an&nbsp;invaluable insight into the film, design and&nbsp;animation processes; with hands on&nbsp;experience. Past projects have also required&nbsp;me to work and liaise with experienced people in there fields of work in dangerous environments, which has provoked upon me a working ethic of concise and very often, sensitive communicational skills both orally&nbsp;and written.&nbsp;</p>\
<p><b>Interest in the media:</b> My enjoyment and&nbsp;critical interest in the media (film,&nbsp;journalism, photography, music and new&nbsp;media) have increased markedly&nbsp;throughout my career, and is continually&nbsp;growing every day.</p>\
<p><b>Computer skills:</b> During University and&nbsp;employment/freelancing, I have&nbsp;gained &amp; expanded my knowledge and confidence of Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, and other renound film, designing &amp; networking packages. I actively enjoy researching on the Internet and with an eye for detail, I am continually striving to learn new ways of meeting projects/clients needs and visions.&nbsp;</p>\
<p><b>Writing/research skills</b>: My exposure to&nbsp;different works of life and clientele needs&nbsp;has proven my ability to express critical&nbsp;opinions within a sustained argument. The&nbsp;experiences of designing and writing, short&nbsp;film scripts and adapting an edit have&nbsp;increased my confidence in these skills.&nbsp;</p>\
<p><b>IT Skills</b>:&nbsp; Over the past years. I have gained&nbsp;experience in PC &amp; Apple Mac Systems. &nbsp;I have been responsible for managing and maintaining the Apple Mac systems and wireless networks for companies in the past. &nbsp;I am of a pleasant disposition and&nbsp;have a variety of diverse skills.&nbsp; I have a&nbsp;flexible and positive approach to work and&nbsp;have the maturity to deal effectively with&nbsp;people and situations.</p>\
<p>I work calmly under pressure and prioritise&nbsp;my workload to meet deadlines as well as&nbsp;being able to work unsupervised and use&nbsp;my initiative.</p>\
<p><b>Competitions/Prizes</b></p>\
<p>Winner and runner up in 25+ golf tournament/competitions at junior and senior club level/county level.&nbsp; Was a member of Hartlepool Junior Golf Team, which won the Southern League County Championship.&nbsp; Semi-finalist of the Northern and southern league four ball championship at county level.&nbsp; Winner of the national police junior qualifier pro-am. &nbsp;Participated in a design competition for BMW&nbsp;to design a loyalty card and information pack at University - came 5th in the United Kingdom.</p>\

<p>Since graduating I have worked on various freelance projects, covering a broad range of styles. From corporate identity to sub-cultural posters &amp; flyers, designing is my passion and I strive for innovation.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I am a hard-working, friendly and honest individual with a sense of humour and a willingness to continually learn within any brief and any environment.</p>\

<p>I am a freelance graphic designer based in Cardiff UK, and have been creating in the field for nearly 10 years.</p>\
<p>I graduated in 1999 with a BA in Industrial Design, and it from there I discovered the power and importance of print and web based graphic design.</p>\
<p>I am a highly adaptable designer and recent work has sent me off creating for the music and entertainments industry, retail and catering and corporate branding. Work has included CD artwork &amp; packaging, flyers, posters, web design, advertising and editorial design, promotional flyer designs, marketing collateral, promotional material, menus, stationary, amongst other things.</p>\
<p>Visually, my main aim is to create a simplistic, yet communicative idea that attaches itself well to the product or project and when required, I work closely with the client in order to achieve this effectively.</p>\
<p>I enjoy mixing photography, with strong typographic elements, using other methods such as negative lithographic printing and purely digital. Also I try to pay special attention to paper-stock type, as texture is an important aspect to my work.</p>\
<p>I adore high quality, yet simple design, and never afraid to push the boundaries in order to create something eye-catching and innovative.</p>\

<p>Me: I have a pr and marketing background and worked for Paul Mitchell Haircare for 6 years in various roles, finishing as Press Office Manager. I was also a model for Paul Mitchell and spent a lot of time in front of the camera as well as organising photo shoots. This led me to discover my passion of photography which I have since developed and am now working as a full time freelance photographer. It&rsquo;s a diverse career which I enjoy immensely as no two days are the same. I love working with different people and helping people come out of their shell in front of the camera. I enjoy all aspects of photography, capturing moments that people can cherish forever.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\

<p>1998-2004 Salon Success &ndash; I worked as personal assistant to the Chairman of the company for two years, travelling around the world and constantly learning. I then moved into the press and marketing side of the business working my way up to be the Press Office manager, continuing in this role for 4 years.</p>\
<p>2004-2005 Travelling &ndash; I spent six months travelling around Asia and Australia exploring different cultures and experiencing new countries, this sparked my love of photography and prompted a career change when I returned to the UK.</p>\
<p>Jan 2005-Jan 2006: I spent a year at City College obtaining a City and Guilds qualification in photography, mainly digital, during this time I also worked as a freelance pr consultant for hairdressing salons in the Manchester area.</p>\
<p>Jan 2006 &ndash; July 2009: I began working as a photographer in Fusion Studios, Manchester, then worked my way up to Head Photographer and Photography Manager. I managed a team of 8 photographers while also working as a photographer in the studio myself. At the same time I also started my own business as a freelance photographer. I worked part time at Fusion Studios while working on my freelance projects side by side for 3 and a half years. In July 2009 I left Fusion Studios to focus on my own photography projects and have been working as a self employed photographer out of my own studio for the past 1 and a half years.</p>\

Experience runs deep and I have worked on national and local accounts. My most important skill is the ability to listen to what is needed and turn the needs and goals into attention getting graphics that get results. I have been hired at companies to clean up and reorganize design departments to be efficient. My supervisors have been pleased with the results. By applying proven techniques I have always saved my companies time and money and attained superior results. I go beyond what is needed and apply my experience to find new ways to get the message across. I work in most design formats including ads, collateral, direct mail, outdoor, trade show graphics, logos, branding, television ads and web site design. Concepting and photo retouching are my specialties.&nbsp;</p>\

I'm responding to your advertisement for the intern job as a in your creative design department.</p>\
<p>As you can see from the enclosed CV, I have a very strong academic background in designs combined with over experience in designing many things such as logos, environment, sketches and painting etc. My recent experience at Green sky creative, London, allowed me to further develop and strengthen my designing skills. When I was working there I had a certain situation when my manager assigned himself to a project he was struggling with, he had only 24 hours to finish before the deadline and was up to his neck trying to figure out the issue so he called me to help but I myself had been assigned to other projects I then helped him and we met the deadline and everything turned out fine and I myself was able to finish my assigned projects in time as well. I believe this event relates to me being always helpful with other and attending those in critical situations. I have good hands on packages like Turbo-CAD, 3DS MAX, PHOTOSHOP, ILLUSTRATOR, TOOMBOOM ANIMATE, FLASH cs4 (all the rest of ADOBE MASTER CS4) along with Adobe Director 11.5. I believe that I could make a significant and valuable contribution for this multimedia role advertised.</p>\
<p>I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my education and experience will be helpful to you. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>\
<p>I am an individual, who is creative, highly motivated with excellent communication skills and the ability to contribute effectively to a team framework. Always willing to learn and not afraid to try new things. I enjoy participating in group sporting activities such as, football, and basketball. Song writing and art are other activities I get up to in my spare time; they bring out my creative side. I enjoy going out with my friends, and travelling to new places to keep myself occupied.</p>","1","1",\N,"1b3bed90-d400-102d-83dd-18ef6839e5d2.doc","7c52e277-d3ff-102d-83dd-18ef6839e5d2.pdf",\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-06-28 12:47:22"

<p>I am writing in response to your mail regarding Artworker. I have upload my sample work for your consideration. It is my objective to obtain a position as a Artworket.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;I worked as graphic designer for five years in India. My roles involve designing cover pages for books publishing and create templates/style sheets for composing books. From my previous work experience I gained lot of practical knowledge by using Indesign, Quark Xpress, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I am glad to bring to your knowledge that I have visited <b>U.S.A</b> representing my organisation twice, while working in S4Carlisle Publishing Service.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;At the moment I am persuing my Masters in Web Development at <b>Staffordshire University</b> and I am going to complete my final semester by 7th May 2010. For your information my University allows me to do internship as a part of my Masters degree. My <b>Study Visa</b> makes me eligible to work as a full time employee for 12 months during my industrial placement and I am able to provide documentation from the University upon request.</p>\
<p>During my Masters level I have chosen my module as Media Editing and Multimedia Application, Mobile Web &amp; Multimedia, Advance Multimedia Systems &amp; Applications and Programming for&nbsp;Web Applications. All these modules enabled me to fine tune all graphical packages and makes an advantage for me to step out my carrier in a right way.</p>\
<p>I am confident that my experience in the field of graphic designer, and my competency, education and research oriented skills that I have developed during my master's course would make me a potential candidate to qualify for this position. To further acquaint you with the specifics of my background I am enclosing my Curriculum Vitae detailing the achievements and qualifications. Looking forward to hear from you in the near future.</p>\

His illustration work employs a realism that seems impossible to capture using only felt-tip markers-and yet his works are breathtakingly grounded and real. As a portrait artist, Neal's subjects include James Taylor, Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, Clint Eastwood, and Pedro Martinez-a sweeping array of entertainers and sports figures.<br /><br />John Gearan of the Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette wrote, \"Nobody seems to be able to do what he does with those things.\"<br /><br />As a caricature artist, Neal's works of individuals at corporate events, trade shows, golf outings, weddings, anniversaries, and more are just the final result of an amazing process that leaves the subject not only with a tangible caricature, but with a humorous memory of being engaged by an enjoyable entertainer.<br /><br />Active in philanthropic causes, Neal's work was commissioned by the Children's Miracle Network to create a multi-action portrait of longtime Duke University basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski; sales of this print will help fund a new wing for the Duke Children's Hospital. Neal's illustration of professional football player Doug Flutie, \"Flutie Through the Years,\" was created for a print series to raise money for the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism. He's also very active with The Jimmy Fund, the fund raising wing of the Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute.<br /><br />Speaking of sports, Neal has illustrated more than 700 programs and media guide covers for NCAA schools such as Michigan State University, University of Virginia, UCLA, Wake Forest University, University of Washington, and Southern Illinois University, to name a few. In addition, he has created limited edition commemoratives for Michigan State University, Yale University, Holy Cross College, and Colgate University. As an athlete himself-a former baseball player and current college pitching coach-Neal uses his personal experience, love of sports, and artistic talent to bring his subjects to life and to give the illustration an evocative quality that leaves the viewer with a sense of the subject's personality and appeal.<br /><br />Doug Flutie, soccer legend Walter Zenga, quarterback Drew Bledsoe, WNBA star Rebecca Lobo, former Boston Red Sox outfielder Dwight Evans, and hockey great Ray Bourque rank among the athletes for whom Neal has created limited edition lithographs, earning him the title of \"The Normal Rockwell of Sports Artists.\" These treasured, one-of-a-kind works grace the walls of athletes and fans alike, and Neal's mastery of the felt-tip marker as an artistic medium makes his work all the more incredible, with unique textures and colors that capture the moment and the person.<br /><br />In the corporate world, The Neal Portnoy Caricature Show adds humor and fun to corporate events, trade shows, and more. Corporations such as Citizens Bank, Iron Mountain Incorporated, Allmerica Financial, Reebok, Starter, Top Flite/Spaulding Worldwide, and ESPN bring Neal on board to provide quick sketch caricature art, entertain audiences, and enrich attendees' experiences. <br /><br />Caricatures, portraits, sports art, live caricature art entertainment, commissioned art-you name it, and Neal does it. His work defies labels-you have to see it for yourself.</p>","1","1",\N,\N,"a8b6783b-6d50-102d-9067-47332d48e295.pdf","92af3927-6d4e-102d-9067-47332d48e295.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-02-17 19:54:24"

<p>MESSAGE FROM FORMER EMPLOYER</p>\
<p>To whom it may concern</p>\
<p>RE: PAUL GRIFFITHS</p>\
<p>Paul joined the Graphic Design team at Furneaux Stewart Design &amp; Communication Limited five years ago and has been employed as a Designer / Graphic Technician until 17 March 2003 when, regrettably, this position was terminated due to redundancy.<br /> During his employment with Furneaux Stewart, Paul worked closely with Senior Graphic Designers and Creative Directors to develop graphic concepts and produce final artworks for a variety of literature and exhibition projects for major international clients such as Bentley Motor Cars, English Heritage, Citroen UK, Volkswagen AG, British Council, Osram Lighting and Heritage Lottery Fund.<br /> He has also produced many design proposals, in various formats, for competitive pitch work, some of them at short notice and involving late night or weekend work.<br /> Paul is hardworking, loyal, polite and diligent and his work has been of the highest standards. His extensive technical knowledge has proved invaluable to the company and ensured that creative work is produced efficiently, of excellent quality, and with minimal interruption. He is a good team member, has always worked well with other members of staff and has participated fully in activities within the company.<br /> The directors are very appreciative of Paul's contribution to the company during his employment with us, and we are extremely sorry to have to lose him. We wish Paul good luck in the future and would have no hesitation in providing a reference or answering any questions from potential employers.</p>\

I enjoy the challenge of creating innovative solutions and gain immense gratification from client satisfaction. My ability to quickly analyse and target companies needs, then execute with effective results maintains good customer relations and profits. I would be an asset to any ambitious firm.</p>\
<p>I have gained invaluable skills, which meet the requirements for numerous creative jobs from my time of working within the graphic design field. My experience in managing projects whether independently on a budget or in house for a major design firm requires the same focus. Paying attention to detail along with excellent time management and effective execution is essential. Great communicational skills are necessary when reaching a desired outcome for all parties. The added bonus of maintaining a good reliable reputation allows me to further build everlasting relationships between clients and other third parties companies.</p>\
<p>Along with working in house I have experience of freelancing, which is most useful in many roles as I enjoy the challenge of involving myself in a number of projects. My past experience within various creative roles benefits me immensely; I have developed a disciplined management approach to multiple tasks. This allows me to ensure all activities meet the specified needs and I devise a workable system for reaching set targets while managing requests for changes. All of this requires quick thoughtful consideration and planning when working within a busy environment.</p>\
<p>In my free time I enjoy reading magazines such as creative review and when possible I like to engage with top designers, I recently had the opportunity to contact Jonathan Barnbrook.&nbsp; Jonathan was kind enough to recommend some highly regarded design books. This gives me an edge of other designers by allowing me to gain key knowledge, invaluable skills and further push boundaries without compromising quality when reaching a client&rsquo;s desired set targets.</p>\

<p>Having worked in various environments, agency, in-house and freelance, I have developed my skills both conceptually and technically. Always wanting to better my previous work, I am driven in wanting to succeed in doing so.</p>\
<p>Having gained vast print experience in marketing and advertising, from POS, brochures, exhibitions, packaging etc in my last role with in an agency, I am looking for that step forward that will truly test my thinking and technical ability.</p>\
<p>I love to learn. I love to be influenced by everything big and small. My passion and spark is fuelled by my love for my life, what grabs me, music, art, history, sport, travel, people, colour, light, fashion, society and the occasional tipple of wine.</p>\
<p>I have the technical skills, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Quark. With good working knowledge of Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks, HTML and CSS.</p>\
<p>I know the smaller things, Acrobat, Distiller, Microsoft Office, Bridge and such.</p>\
<p>If I am honest with myself I know I haven&rsquo;t yet reached my full potential. I have a lot to give. I feel my freelance work has shown my true colours, with my last role restricting my creative input. However without such a role I would not have gained the experience I have found so vital and rewarding.</p>\
<p>To reach my goals, which are added to daily. To answer brief after brief with a smile on my face. To challenge myself. To continuously grow in skills, knowledge and experience. To make myself proud. To never stop learning. To teach wherever I can. To build a strong client relationship no matter how big or small. To be happy in my work every second of the day. To be given the chance to use my mind to create solutions within advertising and marketing and push myself even harder.</p>\

At Huddersfield New College I studied Advanced Level Graphic Art, which covered a wide range of disciplines and an introduction to Adobe Photoshop which I found especially interesting and which helped me develop my skills, providing new influences and ideas&nbsp;to use in my artwork.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;As part of my BA Hons Graphic Design course at the University of Huddersfield, I have become proficient in a wide variety of media software, such as Illustrator, Freehand, Dreamweaver and Flash.&nbsp;From learning the basics, I broadened my knowledge and learnt new skills.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>In the second year I had the pleasure of visiting New York and had set briefs to work on relating to all aspects of marketing of a niche restaurant called Max Brenner. This required close team work and I was able to call upon my three years of experience gained whilst working in busy restaurants.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>The skills I learnt throughout University have been very beneficial towards what I wanted to produce for my final major project, which was to create two publicity outcomes for a chosen music festival, which included, posters, flyers, leaflets, tickets, passes and a live presentation to my tutors. &nbsp;I feel privileged and honoured to be awarded an upper second for the one thing I love doing. At the moment, I have a simple blog with various examples of my work up. (phildearman.blogspot.com)</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Since leaving University, I have been able to use my skills in recent commissions some of which I received a fee.</p>\
<ul>\
<li>Ticket and poster for the Pomegranate Youth Theatre in Chesterfield.</li>\
<li>Poster, Flyer and Letter Head for the Hopton Pantomime Support Group.</li>\
<li>Poster for &lsquo;Tea @ Three&rsquo; for Hopton Pantomime Support Group.</li>\
<li>Advertising Goods Poster for Minster Foods.</li>\
<li>Promotional photographs of a local bands, &lsquo;Three Ways to Fly&rsquo; web site. This was as an indirect result of a music magazine brief. </li>\
</ul>\
<p>I have a great knowledge of the Adobe Creative Suite, including In Design, Photoshop, Illustrator, Freehand and Dreamweaver.</p>\

I am the kind of person who will never settle for &lsquo;that will do&rsquo;. All my work has to be perfect and precise with my determined approach and enthusiasm to any brief. As you will see from my CV and portfolio I have a broad and creative skills that I incorporate in so many different ways.&nbsp; For where I am currently based at the moment I have tasks to create presentation boards for products that I have designed to present the buyer a graphic account of what the products will look like after production.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>One of my main jobs at Slotz Ltd is to design packaging from licensed and generic style guides. The list endless with all the global brands that I created artwork for but a few I can list such as Disney, Marvel, Spear &amp; Jackson etc. Most of the time I work between strict deadlines to send the artwork to factories across the world to print then be shipped to retailers in time for their season. Every deadline I meet even if it means working late to complete the job in hand. Working with printers and factories closely with a good relationship is vital for a project to see through on time. Once the artwork is complete I send all files to the factories in the UK, China, Israel or Turkey with confirmation I have sent them.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Part of my job that I feel I do very well is finding the cheapest but the best quality supplier for materials or services for print. I manage a large format printer in house which is used to print out graphics such as POS, showroom graphics, packaging etc. Some buyers like to see a mock up of a product in it&rsquo;s packaging before they approve and sign the project off.&nbsp; Baring in mind the cost of this to produce in house. Luckily I have managed to build my own supplier contacts, which I have good relationships with who provide me with materials that are best value for money compared to their competitors. Great business for all involved.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Many of my design work involve photography. This would be another strong strength of mine when it comes to in-house photography for products, scenery, portraits, wildlife etc. Sometimes there are instances where I am unable to capture the image you are hoping for. This could be due to time of year where the shoot is taking place. Trying to capture a summary feel in November would not work so on occasions I would need to manipulate the image accordingly and re-touch the image to have more satisfying approach on the packaging, catalogue or poster for instance. Airbrushing is a common technique I use while working on re-touching images. Also changing colours on products to give an alternative option during development and superimposing an object into another image to ensure its life like.&nbsp; Along with photography I also use a lot of illustrations that I draw by hand or vectored using Adobe Illustrator.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I have knowledge in web design working in CSS and XHTML coding when building or maintaining a website. I have no difficulty uploading images or information onto an already live web site or even changing it&rsquo;s appearance.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I do work as a freelance designer in my spare time, taking up projects that provide me with extra knowledge and experience. Currently I have been designing clothing for an Urban/street brand along with designing clothing for my own fashion label that I plan to unveil as a business prospect for the future.&nbsp; I sometimes incorporate influences from my hobbies and interests into my creativity. Music for one provides me with the most fluency and flair. I used to produce music a few years ago as an interest before working as a designer Full-time but this gave me the basis to build upon. Now this has transitioned into my clothing, which I also market for sports such as football and athletics, the two sports where I have been most successful in.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>As a summary, I have 2 years experience already in the designing industry having gained knowledge of creating artwork from&nbsp;style guides and from a generic layout and Product Design. As you will notice from my Resume I have experience in designing for Fashion, Packaging, POS, Planogram Visuals, Presentation sheets Show room and Trade show graphics along with more creative design skills including illustrations, Photography and In house photography, XHTML and CSS coding in Dreamweaver CS4. Motion and Visual Graphics in After Effects.</p>","1","2",\N,"1d420122-c5f5-102d-bce2-f8fb01135a8b.pdf","4f83db43-89a6-102d-81f7-17bd6ff57f99.pdf","6a36bf91-c5f5-102d-bce2-f8fb01135a8b.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-03-25 21:31:11"

<p>My last contract role was at a charity for architects involved in development and disaster relief. Here I managed two projects, firstly creating a website for http://www.dotngo.net to canvass opinions and initiate discussion on setting up a new domain for the not-for-profit sector. As well as implementing the presentation and design framework, I was also responsible for editorial content, to kick start this globally far reaching project.</p>\
<p>Previously I worked long-term at http://www.truetube.co.uk, an online video streaming site for young people. I was the front end developer for this LAMP site and managed the projects and tasks myself.</p>\
<p>This included duties under web development, web design, web accessibility (W3C standards) and web marketing. The marketing side included Google Analytics, SEO, social networking promotion and campaigns.</p>\
<p>In this role I had to work hard under pressure, prioritise tasks and work with a team who helped launch our video issues. Hence I have experience of using my communication, editorial and project management skills in time sensitive situations.</p>\
<p>Technologies I used were using XHTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP/MySQL, Photoshop and Flash. I used all of these for the creation of our mother company's website http://www.ctvc.co.uk .</p>\
<p>For two years I trained in the ASP.NET environment, passing all exams and modules to become a Microsoft Accredited Applications Developer.</p>\
<p>I would be interested in discussing this opportunity further and enclose my CV for your consideration.</p>\
<p>Kind regards,</p>\

<p>My name is Rodrigo Lignini and I'm a Graphic designer as you can image.&nbsp;My last working role was Art Director / Senior Desgigner, there I've been working for 4+ years.</p>\
<p>I born in Buenos Aires (Arg) but my family is italian so I am eligible to work in the UK.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Today I live in London, I've moved here 15 days ago because my wife and I love this city and because I know is here where you must be if you want to be a really graphic designer.</p>\
<p>I have more than 10 years of experience as a graphic designer. I've been working a lot and hardly during these years and now I'm ready to go to the next level in my career.</p>\
<p>My working method is based primarily on the development of concepts because I'm convinced that any artwork/graphic design needs a theoretical framework.</p>\
<p>I would like to get this job because I believe I have the qualities that you requires.</p>\
<p>I attach my CV with my web site (on-line folio showcaseing of my work) and behance link.</p>\

<p><b>Work Experience</b></p>\
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p>Before I decided to pursue Business Studies at University, I had also thought of becoming at doctor. I got offered a week of work experience in Lagan Valley Hospital, Lisburn. Some of the feedback given from my employer at that time was, &ldquo;He is a polite and well mannered gentleman, who was always on time to work. He dressed very appropriately for the job and listened to instructions carefully.&rdquo;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><b>Cosine </b>&ndash; October 2010 &ndash; Present</p>\
<p>Cosine is a sampling company that works in close connection with Sainsburys. My job is to let customers sample a lot of branded products within a Sainsburys store. I get set sales targets set by outside companies in which I have to reach daily. I talk to the customers promoting different brands all the time. This has given me a lot of skills in marketing and sales.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p><b>Superdry </b>&ndash;<b> </b>September 2009 &ndash; June 2010</p>\
<p>This is a clothes store in which I worked all day Saturday and all day Sunday. Like Marks and Spencer I deal with customer queries and assist customers in what they wish to purchase. This job has further improved my commercial awareness and social skills when dealing with customers. I left this post in June as I went to America for 6 weeks to visit family.</p>\

I have a team of staff working below me who I manage and make sure they are bringing enough numbers into the club for me and my manager. I have therefore learned not only how to work for someone, but also what it is like for someone to work for me. I left this post as I could not hold 2 jobs whilst at University.</p>\

<p>I have worked in the graphic design industry for just over 5 years within two advertising agencies in North Devon. I have also done some freelancing work in this time.<br /><br />My last position was with a company called Bray Leino. I worked in a number of <br />business units all of which had specific categories of clients. These included; oil, <br />gas and automotive, I.T and technology, pharmaceutical, leisure and food and drink. <br />My work consisted of consumer and trade advertising, brochures, identities, <br />packaging, point of sale, television commercials and web design.<br /><br />I also worked along side the Creative Director exclusively for 6 months on pitch work <br />to win new business for the agency.</p>\

<p><b>I am a British luxury shoe designer, recently completed my Masters degree in&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Fashion Footwear at the prestigious Cordwainers institution now owned by&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>London College of Fashion. Cordwainers College is acknowledged mainly for its&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>excellence and for the birth of household names such as Jimmy Choo, Camila&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Skovguard, Rupert Sanderson, Nicholas Kirkwood amongst many others.&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Since completing my Masters course in March 2010, I started interning and now&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>freelancing for Kat Maconie, designing luxury ladies shoes, which are stocked at&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Harvey Nichols, John Lewis, Whistles and Japan. My Autumn / Winter 2010 shoes&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>have been worn by Award winning, British singer Katie Malua for her 2010 CD&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>promotion. I have recently been commissioned to design a spectacular pair of&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>boots for R&amp;B legend Faith Evans. Actress Jemima Rooper is wearing my AW&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>2010 styles on a 5 page spread of You magazine. In trend, ASDF online, Fashion&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>United and Beautiful Fineries have all interviewed me and featured my A/W 2010&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Collection. &nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Each pair of bespoke shoes was made by hand in North London. I collaborated&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>with some of the best artisans in order to produce the collection. I also have&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>access to a factory in East London, were I am able to produce numerous&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>prototypes before reaching the final product.&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>My father introduced me to bespoke shoe making. I headed straight to&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>&lsquo;Cordwainers&rsquo; after my GCSE exams wanting to fulfil my great desire to design&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>and make shoes. My foundation course, BA (Hons) and Masters Degrees have all&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>been undertaken at Cordwainers Institution. &nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>For my final BA collection I collaborated with Churches footwear (owned by&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Prada). Since graduating from Cordwainers and before pursuing the MA, I worked&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>for Italian firm Pitti Capital, as well as undertaking extensive freelance work.&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>Whilst living in Italy I perfected the language by solely speaking in Italian. I&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>undertook the MA in order to specialise in ladies footwear design and as a&nbsp;</b></p>\
<p><b>platform for producing luxury shoes for the fashion conscious, modern woman. &nbsp;</b></p>\

<p>Born and raised in Kolkata, I developed a love for writing from my schooldays at Don Bosco Park Circus and continued to nurture that liking right through my college life at St. Xavier&rsquo;s. But I had never thought about making a career out of it. As it happened, I was never a very serious student and so Science was out of the question and I opted for the second alternative-Commerce and did my B.Com Hon&rsquo;s. Along with it I also was ranked 2nd in Costing (Inter). That&rsquo;s when I got bored! I went in for a walk-in-interview and got a job as Management Trainee with Gujarat Ambuja, Kolkata and was placed in their In-house Corporate Communications Department. That was my first brush with advertising and I was lucky to work under a great writer &ndash; Joyobroto Chatterjee. After seeing some of my writings, he was the one who encouraged me to make a career in copywriting. That&rsquo;s when I went for my first ever Copy Test with National Advertising. The number of people who came for the test took me aback. Most were elder to me and I was sure that I didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. Well, I was in for a pleasant surprise when next week I got a call from the agency saying that I had been selected. That&rsquo;s how I landed my first job as a Copywriter, and have since then never looked back. During this time I had visions of stardom (like any other young boy). I gave auditions first with Times FM and was selected as an RJ and did some shows with them. Later on I again attended an audition when ETV was launching their Bengali channel in Kolkata. Well, I was chosen and then for the next 6 months I had a rollicking time anchoring a road show for them on Saturdays and Sundays and working from Monday to Friday as a copywriter. (At this time I was working with Radiant Adv., a leading Kolkata agency.) Then came the time when the agency wanted to promote me to the post of&nbsp;Creative Director, Copy and needed my full time. So, I had to make a choice. TV anchor or copywriter? I opted for the second one. Glamour took a backseat to my love for writing. Since then I have moved out of Kolkata and worked as Creative Director (Copy) for Crayons Advertising, Jaipur. Now I'm back in Kolkata and have entered the completely new industry of e-Learning, as a Senior Specialist - Instructional Design with Tata Interactive Systems (TIS) in Kolkata. My principle behind this move being that it is always wise to broaden your scope as a writer.</p>\
<p>It&rsquo;s been an exciting journey till now, with some awards also received down the line. But I have never written for awards, rather I have written for clients. And, there is no greater incentive for me to write than &ldquo;writing for the sake of writing&rdquo;! Over the years, I have fallen in love with the entire creative process: brainstorming ideas, shaping concepts, delivering results. What can I say; I have always loved a challenge. My goal is to stretch my creative scope and to seize bigger and better opportunities.</p>\

<p>Hello.</p>\
<p>I am currently working for a brand agency called Tsuko as an art director. &nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>My 15 years&rsquo; experience has involved creating and producing advertising campaigns&nbsp;</p>\
<p>for various brands and clients using TV, press, posters, radio, DM, digital/interactive&nbsp;</p>\
<p>and ambient media. I&rsquo;ve loved every minute of it and enjoyed lots of laughs along the way.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Working in this fast moving and highly demanding environment has sharpened my natural&nbsp;</p>\
<p>creativity and given me the ability to quickly understand a client&rsquo;s brief in order to provide&nbsp;</p>\
<p>original and effective ideas across all media. As you would expect from someone with many years advertising experience, I&rsquo;m comfortable overseeing creative output and also developing junior teams to be the best they can be. Plus I make a tip top cup of tea or fresh coffee.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I&rsquo;d love to pop in and show you my book and have a chat. &nbsp;</p>\
<p>You can contact me on&nbsp;simon@ideasgarden.info&nbsp;</p>\

But it's the warm-ware (between my ears) that really makes things happen.<br /><br />I bring my experience and expertise to your projects. Working with many bigger than life clients like Siemens and Coca-Cola gave me nerve and confidence. And working with lots of small clients like my friends at Wood Hill Veterinary Clinic where my cat Deni enjoys his visits as much as I do, granted me perspective and spirit to step up to the plate and concoct a creative solution that gives you the wiggle room to grow and the spice to stand out in a crowd.<br /><br />I pride myself in meeting deadlines, asking the right questions and creating lasting relationships with lots of good people who are also my clients. &nbsp;Along the way, we create a lot of good work. &nbsp;I hope I can help you with your communication projects and become part of the team you rely upon. &nbsp;I know I'll enjoy meeting you. &nbsp;I'm new to creativesRus so I'd be happy to supply you with references.</p>","1","1",\N,"910fb324-8380-102d-b4d5-80ea14a3f6e6.pdf",\N,"76c8fd8e-8379-102d-b4d5-80ea14a3f6e6.jpg","0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-03-18 00:56:54"

<p>I am an Italian citizen just relocated to London together with my husband and&nbsp;children. I graduated in Milan with a First Class Bachelor of Arts degree with honours, in Architecture. Alongside my strong educational background I have&nbsp;over ten years of employment history as&nbsp;a journalist and stylist within the interior, design, architecture, fashion, lifestyle, trend and art sectors. In 2001 I became a member of the Italian Journalist's Association.</p>\
<p>I would welcome the&nbsp;opportunity to work for a creative company with the prospect of contributing to its&nbsp;goals, talent and future visions. Having read my CV I hope it is evident that I am a multi-skilled,&nbsp;dynamic, self-motivated and committed individual. Moreover, I have an&nbsp;inner-drive for&nbsp;constant improvement and learning and I&rsquo;m certain that all of&nbsp;these attributes can provide real value to any organisation.</p>\
<p>I would like to briefly&nbsp;highlight some of the key skill-sets, which I believe that I can offer:</p>\
<p><b>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Editor&nbsp;and Stylist</b>.&nbsp;For the last eight years I have been working as&nbsp;a reliable and passionate Editor for Elle Decor Italy - an architecture,&nbsp;interior&nbsp;design, lifestyle and trends magazine. This role has enabled me&nbsp;to work as part of the editorial team writing and organizing articles on news, events, trends&nbsp;and styles within the design world, as well as creating specific interior design&nbsp;sets for photo-shoots.</p>\
<p><b>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Research</b>.&nbsp;Detailed research and gathering is required for each&nbsp;article and photo-shoot that ranges from, contacting and interviewing&nbsp;architects, artists,&nbsp;interior and product designers; visiting European trade fairs including the&nbsp;renown Milan Furniture Fair; drawing on my PR&nbsp;agency and supplier network;&nbsp;location and product hunting; attending shop, hotel and restaurant openings&nbsp;together with exhibition private&nbsp;viewings.</p>\
<p><b>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Team&nbsp;work.</b>&nbsp;The development and&nbsp;completion of every editorial involves a close working relationship with the&nbsp;director, art director and&nbsp;graphic designers, whilst adhering to Elle Decor&rsquo;s&nbsp;overall image, graphic design language and content, as well as respecting&nbsp;important&nbsp;timeframes and deadlines.&nbsp;</p>\
<p><b>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Free-lance.</b>&nbsp;Alongside Elle Decor I have built-up a reputation as a freelancer working as: writer&nbsp;for Elle, Vogue, Marie Claire, Grazia Casa, Interni, Marie Claire Maison, Elle Decor and Io Donna&nbsp;(Corriere Della Sera&rsquo;s&nbsp;broadsheet&nbsp;newspaper&nbsp;supplement); chief editor of&nbsp;Federmobili, a trade based furniture and interior design magazine;</p>\
<p><b><b>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leonardo Tv,&nbsp;</b>contents consultant </b>&nbsp;a design and architectural oriented SKY TV channel, special task, trend setting and feature researcher;</p>\
<p><b>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Interior Design Stylist and Art Buyer,</b> for advertising campaigns, catalogues and shop windows, clients&nbsp;include: Ermenegildo Zegna, Fratelli Graziano and Bossi; event stylist and organiser for&nbsp;Benetton, Dornbracht and&nbsp;Rex.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Outside the workplace I have travelled broadly within Europe and across&nbsp;the rest of the world and during certain stages of my life I have lived in England, Italy and Finland. &nbsp;I enjoy&nbsp;taking on the challenge of adapting to new and interesting environments as well&nbsp;as embracing different working&nbsp;styles and cultures.</p>\
<p>I would be more than happy to meet up for an interview to discuss matters in further detail, together with a presentation of&nbsp;my&nbsp;portfolio. In the meantime, please I would like also to send you my curriculum together with my mail-out portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Please do not hesitate&nbsp;in contacting me for any questions or further clarifications. I look forward to&nbsp;hearing from you.&nbsp;</p>\

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with some very&nbsp;talented people from which I have learned much. My work has&nbsp;taken me around the world and I&rsquo;ve had the chance to enjoy&nbsp;working in different cultures.</p>\
<p>I have also gained experience in an unusually diverse range&nbsp;of disciplines; T.V, Packaging, DM, Exhibitions, Poster campaigns,</p>\
<p>Branding Identity and Brand Policing. Over my 20 year career I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;worked in just about every sector going and as a result I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;developed a strong understanding of visual communication&nbsp;and of how to engage a target audience. I am proud to say that&nbsp;in whole career I have never missed a deadline.</p>\
<p>My approach</p>\
<p>For me design is the fusion of creativity and commerce. This is&nbsp;the basis of my approach towards my work. The key factors&nbsp;in any successful piece of visual marketing are: relevance to&nbsp;the target audience, differentiation of the offering, and an&nbsp;understanding of the motivations of the &lsquo;customer&rsquo;. Without any&nbsp;of these factors being taken into consideration we are not&nbsp;communicating with our audience. It is also my belief that all the&nbsp;software in the world will not save you from badly conceived ideas.</p>\

<p>Having been an integral part of a design team I have worked across a wide range of projects from traditional design for print, point of sale advertising, product design and 3D concepts, through to printing, production and market placement.</p>\
<p>Having worked at Regency Design and Print for this time I have a very in depth knowledge of the studio, design agency and print house environment.&nbsp;I have a thorough understanding of all forms of design, print and creativity within a business. Through highly skilled mac work I have created design for a wide range of clients, across varying briefs and platforms. The most common programs used being Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. In&nbsp; addition to these, on a slightly lesser scale, Flash and Cinema 4D.<br /><br />Having worked closely with top brands such as Cadbury, Nestle, Kraft, Coca Cola, GSK and Britvic, I understand the need to communicate with the client to make sure the end result is achieved successfully. I embraced my company&rsquo;s work ethic; seeing each project through from start to finish, making sure each detail is methodically checked. I feel that by being an integral part of the whole process, it has enabled me to gain different perspectives on what is needed to create competent and effective results.</p>\
<p>In the time I have worked for Regency, I have shown full commitment and dedication to each task and role that I have undertaken. I have learnt to expect the unexpected and deal with any difficulties that may arise at any given moment with cool and calm composure. I understand the need to work to flexible hours and the necessity to work to tight deadlines to get the job done to the best possible standard.</p>\
<p>My genuine enthusiasm for visual impact and making graphics work for a  variety of audiences and mediums is what drives and excites me.&shy;&shy; I  enjoy finding new ways to challenge myself and improve my current skill  set, whether it be through design or any other creative outlet.</p>\
<p>I am an innovative, hard working and personable individual with a flare for the creative and the ability to work both independently and within a team. I am flexible and reliable and find it easy to keep a healthy balance between work and play.</p>\
<p>I'm now really looking to move on to a different company with new challenges and experiences and am actively seeking in my hometown of Brighton and also London, but am open to places that may fall in the surrounding areas.</p>\

<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I am currently a freelancing at various advertisng agencies and managing 2 of my own clients.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Most recently I was the creative lead on the &pound;22m Orange account for three years at Chemistry Communications.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>My role when I joined was to help bed in this muti-media, high volume and fast turnaround account, whilst continually looking to improve creative output.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I helped the agency meet, and in a lot of cases, exceeded their response targets. I also took the initiative to produce developmental campaigns to help push the boundaries for Orange, to keep them fresh in the direct space. This included digital, press, poster, DM, radio and ambient media.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>As part of my day to day work I am used to analysing, questioning, writing and solving briefs aimed at a variety of target audiences, both consumer and business, using appropriate media and presenting concepts directly to clients.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>I'm able to work in most mediums, online, direct mail, press, posters, TV, radio, ambient - just about anywhere that is relevant to get a clients message across.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p>You can see examples of some of my work on Orange and other 360 campaigns at http://www.abitoftony.me.uk/</p>\

I use the program to design and create artwork from scratch, and also to enhance, manipulate or touch-up my own photography. I am sufficient in the use of Adobe Illustrator and use the program in conjunction with Photoshop on certain projects. I enjoy the challenge of arranging artwork on a page and finding a balance within the layout, for this I use Adobe InDesign, creating both print and web based layouts for any circumstance or requirement. All of my design work is created using Mac OSX 10.6.3 and I consider myself fluent in the use of this operating system, all of my Adobe products are Creative Suite 5 and I am constantly learning new techniques and ways in which to produce my work. I have a keen eye for photography using my digital SLR camera, and express a great interest in the subject. I enjoy motor-sport photography and have attended many events including the Isle of Man TT races and many rally&#700;s across the UK. In recent years I have expanded to landscape photography, working with panoramic compositions and advanced lighting techniques. I enjoy working as part of a small team, where each individual is made to feel an important part of the process.</p>","1","1",\N,"e5a677f9-ef84-102d-a7ba-ea81c865a302.pdf",\N,\N,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2010-06-03 11:00:28"

"646","Wayne","Hay","Graphic Designer","mskeys1","waynehay1@gmail.com","07974617578","Flat 2, Heritage Court","15 Warstone Lane","Birmingham","66","b18 6hp","<p>During my career I have gained a wealth of valuable knowledge, skills and experience including; learning new software and hardware for high quality commercial design production, many aspects of project management from conceptual ideas to completion (including final checks at print stage and delivery of items to both internal and external locations to exact customer specification); developing brand identities, managing, sourcing and maintaining suppliers for a variety of printed materials, monitoring studio performance, scheduling projects, building strong client relationships and liaising with media specialists etc.</p>\
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the experience of working, in both the private and public sector, so I have an understanding on how information design, can help drive successful marketing campaigns, locally, regionally and nationally within both sectors.</p>\
<p>In my previous job roles it has allowed me to develop my natural creativity and yet still being able to execute professional design solutions, working under strict corporate guidelines and various brand identities. Whilst working in the public sector as a 'graphic designer' at ACMC (2004-2008). I self-managed the in-house design unit, which covered a multitude of job responsibilities. I ensured that all work was correctly scheduled and produced on-time; literature (including proof reading) and all imagery were accurate and error-free (providing additional editorial content if necessary). This involved me being a creative all-rounder designing for print, web and multimedia applications. This allowed me to have a solid understanding of integration on programs across the full Adobe creative suite. My job responsibility also included working as lead designer for one of Birmingham's most cutting edge community radio stations New Style Radio 98.7fm.</p>\
<p>Typical roles included the daily website maintenance of New Style Radio, and the subdivisions of the ACMC website which included, Frantz Fanon Research Unit, Social Welfare Department and Business/Marketing Department of ACMC. I produced designs, publications and online material for the radio department at ACMC, which covered areas like media training for schools, colleges and universities etc. My designs successfully contributed towards an array of commercial marketing solutions, which helped promote the radio station and generate business, in and around Birmingham.</p>\
<p>I worked closely with directors, coordinators and account managers to organise invoicing orders, and also covered that all work was produced with correct budgets on-time, sourcing the best materials and resources available from our own organic database of trusted suppliers. An example of this was my involvement of a highly successful 450K Heritage Lottery Funded Project in 2007-2008 called &ldquo;Three Continents, One History&rdquo;. The project objectives were to educate the general public on Birmingham&rsquo;s historical links with the Transatlantic Slave Trade. It was imperative information was clearly delivered to a diverse mix of the local community. Particular aspects of this project required me to liaise directly with writing/editorial teams consisting of researchers, academics and professors, where I partly code a unique CMS for the project. I also contributed towards the marketing, advertising and general publicity of the project; using print, digital and online e-commerce web applications where necessary, to communicate project objectives and capture particular target audiences; (mostly in the form of materials produced for exhibition, dm, print, off-line and online purposes). Future aspects of the project at that time included developing bilingual versions of the website and publications, making it accessible for countries in different continents. Working on a project like this in the local community emphasised the importance of communication through my designs.</p>\
<p>Whist working as Creative Artworker at West Bromwich Building Society in 2008, I successfully completed a maternity leave cover contract. Working in a busy corporate marketing department at the principle office, my main responsibilities were to take on briefs directly from the heads of departments, campaign managers, branch staff, external agencies and produce artwork for both e-commerce and print applications. It was vital to enforce the established brand identity of the society, through adhering to the corporate guidelines. During my time working with the in-house studio team. In the ever changing, commercial environment of the financial services I found designing and artworking within the marketing team not only challenging, but also very rewarding. In my job at the ACMC I was used to working to tight deadlines, however in the role at the building society, it enforced my own belief that I can work well under extreme pressure, and deliver accurate work error-free. For example, during a Bank of England Rate change, between the other lenders and Banks in the FSA, there would be a slight cooling off period before new savings and investments products were announced. As soon as the rates were signed off from the society financial board members, potentially there would be up to 70 existing products that would urgently need designing and printing; to get into branches across the country within a few days. This would be ranging from a variety of advertising material, flyers, posters, magazines, direct mail etc. That included full artworking and obtaining all necessary approvals, ensuring all work was accurate and correct, and also making sure on a technical level, that all work sent to the printers was to the original specification in terms of colours, layout and pagination. This also included managing any other internal briefs that might have come in. Attention to detail during this time was critical as any errors especially in a Rate change would have a serious effect on the commercial viability of a product, and could also drastically effect overall project budgets.</p>\
<p>It was essential for members of the design team, to have the appropriate training and understanding of this network operation. Scheduling workloads in this role was also important, in the absence of senior management, I personally liked to keep track on how far myself and the other designers in the studio were progressing. I suggested a few improvements to the team about studio performance, simply emailing a daily report, helped ensure a smooth running of projects. The software I used specifically was Filemaker Pro which helped schedule general project workflow. Archiving work was also important, completed work sent to the print suppliers were archived on a daily basis, making sure images, fonts and print specifications were verified and collected together. In addition to this; I would send daily reports on my own projects/workloads to the marketing services manager updating them on my progress; and because it was a friendly calm studio environment, we had no problem sharing expertise in the software when others needed assistance. <br /> <br /> Occasionally we were asked to stay over our normal working hours to ensure projects met completion deadline. This was an essential part of my own systematic approach. I added value to this aspect of the role because I was acknowledged by the head of marketing and the marketing services manager for my extreme professionalism whilst working at the society. Another important area of my work at the society was ensuring the brand; principles and values were executed in every aspect of literature/design. One example of this was abiding by the society&rsquo;s (TCF principle) which stood for &lsquo;Treating customers fairly&rsquo;. It was essential for all customers to make sure they were consistently recognised as being the priority; this process was regularly monitored by the FSA. Fundamentals to key information design were crucial in this area.</p>\
<p>In my career I have produced an array of marketing materials for digital and print. On a technical level I feel I have a thorough awareness of colour swatches and systems, typesetting and pagination in both print and digital applications. This also includes preparing documents in pre-flight stages; also checking artwork and html coding with regards to web design accessibility. I have had the experience of converting file formats on cross platforms. Including integrating designs, audio and video applications within both Mac and PC systems.&nbsp; I have gained knowledge in troubleshooting in particular with the Adobe creative suite programs (Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, Acrobat reader etc).</p>\
<p>This has allowed me to further develop my understanding of technical requirements in web design, where I feel in this area I could add value to the role.</p>\
<p>In my previous roles I have worked closely with heads of departments, print suppliers, campaign managers, directors, studio and account managers, design agencies and project coordinators. This has been an integral part of my development as a graphic designer and I have greatly valued working in the both the public and private sector as this had allowed me to interpret design briefs creatively, in different ways.</p>\
<p>I am comfortable to work in a team or as an individual, self-manage my own timetable and work to project completion deadlines. I am able to interact with different departments, and people from a variety of working levels. I have found it essential in my work to adhere to corporate guidelines, maintaining strong brand identity and ensuring work sent to print suppliers, has been signed-off by relevant stakeholders confirming work is both legal and compliant. I am able to take constructive criticism thoughtfully with my designs, and can work towards problem solving and achieving excellent results.</p>\
<p>I have also found it imperative that my design work overall achieves the full purpose of the design brief / specification and clearly reaches the target audience in a direct manner.</p>\
<p>My key personal strengths include:</p>\
<p>&bull; Creative and innovative<br />&bull; Team player<br />&bull; Confident and enthusiastic about design<br />&bull; Ability to work under pressure<br />&bull; Excellent time keeping<br />&bull; Pursuing Professionalism</p>\
<p>My key PC / Mac computing experience includes knowledge of the following software:</p>\

<p>Hello,  Please allow me to introduce myself- my name is Michael David Stoebe. My most recent position was as a Design Manager in the Graphic Design / Home Textiles &amp; De&eacute;cor Fields, before moving to London. I recently came upon your website CreativesRUs.com&nbsp;and would like to submit my CV in consideration for available positions in the Graphic / Textile Industries.</p>\
<p>I have always had a keen interest in the arts and an extensive background in Graphic Design and Textiles. I have worked mainly in Designing Licensed Product, in both the Home Textile and Apparel fields, having worked with many licensed brands- including Martha Stewart, Betty Crocker, The Sharper Image and Coppertone, for kitchen, bath and beach and Disney, Warner Brothers, Nickelodeon and HIT Entertainment for children&rsquo;s home hard and soft goods and apparel. I also have a great deal of experience designing my own, generic (non-Licensed) designs.</p>\
<p>As you can see from my CV, I have over eighteen years of experience in the design industry. I have a great deal of experience working directly with the licensing directors and agents of these brands to streamline the design process and achieve a well designed, top selling product. I also have an extensive background dealing directly with mills and factories, over seeing the complete design process, from designing the initial concept through to approving ready to ship production.  I am a team leader, both hard working and dedicated. I believe I have a great deal to offer your company!</p>\
<p>Please review my CV at your leisure and please feel free to email me or telephone me with any questions that you may have regarding my CV or to set up an appointment to meet. Thank you for your consideration!!</p>\

<p>Although I am currently working as a Creative Designer in Wolverhampton, I have, until recently, been employed as a Studio Manager in a marketing agency for numerous years.

Some of my work can be viewed electronically via 'pdf' files, and hard copies of many kinds of literature are also available on request.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>To be a successful designer and team member my excellent communication skills are required on a daily basis, from liaising with clients to enable us to fulfill the specifications of the work required, to sharing ideas and delegating workloads. Creativity, a flair for design work and a positive attitude are essential.</p>\
<p>I am presently looking to further my career aspirations and believe this position will help me to do this by allowing me to use my creative skills and originality to promote and enhance the company I work for.</p>\
<p>I am extremely confident in using all the necessary software packages and producing artwork from concept to print ready artwork for catalogues, brochures, leaflets, prospectuses, annual reports, branding, corporate ID's packaging and exhibition stand design. I have the ability to work under pressure, to tight time scales and can be relied on to use my own initiative as well as working as a team member.</p>\
<p>I am passionate about design and the positive effects it can have on advertising and merchandising to both consumers and the business sector. &nbsp;My attitude, artistic flair and abilities would be an attribute to any organisation and it would be fantastic to have an impact in a dynamic new environment.&nbsp;</p>\

The manager would ring me up to design a kitchen through a certain specification and render it for client approval but at the same time I could be taking phone calls and messages or generate letters and faxing them to clients. I could also be asked to store and organise the filing cabinet with all of the kitchen designs as well as fix the computer if it broke down.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;My experience is working at Saltwell signs were I produced drawing of proposed signage for client approval, analyzing briefs and creating design proposals and assisting studio staff and designing business cards.
